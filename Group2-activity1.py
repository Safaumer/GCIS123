The following code uses the turtle library to draw 3 lines of hexagon, circle and square 
with appropriate spaces between them. 8 functions have been used out of which 5 functions 
are those mentioned in the rubrics. All the functions are finally combined directly or indirectly in 
the main(). 
Initially, the code will ask for input from the user and based on the input the colors of the figures
vary. These inputs are passed as arguments for the other functions. For this very reason, I have 
made the variables that hold the input values global. 
Once the input is obtained, the main() is encountered. the background color and the turtle's initial
position is set in main(). Following this, the pattern is drawn. (pattern())

this function will determine the x value of where the turtle needs
to be moved for the next shape to be drawn. This is done by 
determining the current position of x first, followed by specifying the change in x coordinate

does the same but for the y coordinate.
